echo "This script demonstrates the advanced pattern detection capabilities"
echo "that are being implemented in EmberDB. The following algorithms will"
echo "be available soon:"
echo ""
echo "1. Seasonal Decomposition"
echo "   - Automatically extracts trend, seasonal patterns, and residuals"
echo "   - Identifies daily/weekly/monthly cycles in medical data"
echo "   - Supports both additive and multiplicative models"
echo ""
echo "2. Multivariate Outlier Detection"
echo "   - Identifies anomalies across related measurements"
echo "   - Mahalanobis distance for correlated variables"
echo "   - Auto-discovers related metrics"
echo ""
echo "3. Change Point Detection"
echo "   - CUSUM and PELT algorithms for detecting significant shifts"
echo "   - Quantifies magnitude and confidence of detected changes"
echo "   - Identifies when patients shift to new health states"
echo ""
echo "4. Moving Window Analysis"
echo "   - Detects local volatility, trend changes, and range anomalies"
echo "   - Configurable window and step sizes"
echo "   - Supports multiple analysis methods within windows"
echo ""
echo "These capabilities will be configurable via a TOML file 'detection_config.toml'"
echo "that allows for detailed customization of parameters for each algorithm."
echo ""
echo "============================================================="
echo "The implementation is currently in progress. Please check back soon!"
